# ADS-B Exchange Setup Script :airplane:

Feeding ADSBexchange.com is quick and easy. There are various options depending on what kind of feeder/receiver you use,
and your desired level of customization. This script aids in setting up your current PiAware or Dump1090 based feeder to
feed ADS-B Exchange. Although not required it is recommended that FlightAwareâ€™s PiAware be used to feed data to
ADSB-Exchange in order to send the most accurate MLAT results to the co-op.
